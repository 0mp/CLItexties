# CLItexties
Post to txti.es from the commandline

### Usage

Simply use `CLItexties.sh -i` to enter content and custom url/editcode.

Or use `CLItexties.sh -f [path to file] [custom URL] [custom edit code]` to post the contents of a file. To simplify usage with scripts if an custom URL is already in use, you get a "randomized" one, to make sure posting never fails if used non-interactivly.

If you used `MyCoolPost` as customized URL you'll find your post at `http://txti.es/MyCoolPost` and the edit link would be `http://txti.es/MyCoolPost/edit`.
